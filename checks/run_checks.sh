# run_checks.sh -- end-to-end checks of the Mojo rules. Each check can fail.
#
# usage: checks/run_checks.sh            (from the repo root; BUCK2 overrides the binary)
#
#   1. The examples build and their run checks pass (stdout compared byte for
#      byte), and every action that executed ran remotely.
#   2. The gate: checks//libgate_bad fails with GATED TEST FAILED, while its
#      [ungated] package builds -- the red comes from the test, not the compile.
#   3. Packages reach the compiler only through `deps`: a binary importing
#      hellopkg without depending on it fails to compile.
#   4. The toolchain refuses an incomplete closure (exit 2) instead of falling
#      back to anything on the worker.
#   5. No action argv or env names an absolute host path.
